I attest to that fact that, of the time spent working on this project,
at least seventy-five (75) percent was spent working with the person

I attest that I have written every line of code that I have submitted
and I take full responsibility for the origin of all the code submitted.
In particular, if any of the code was originally written in a previous
semester or another course I will so acknowledge via e-mail to the
grader.
